# Project: IntelliQ

IntelliQ is a web application that is created by undergraduate students of the department of Electrical And Computer Engineering, NTUA, Athens. This application is used for the creation, submission and management of "smart" questionnaires. A questionnaire is considered "smart" when the next provided question depends on the answer of the previous one.
In the current project, a REST-API is implemented with several services provided (you can check on the API Documentation to see more details). Clients of the REST-API are a Frontend environment and a CLI which perform requests on the API for several tasks (check Documentation on the frontend and cli folders respectively).

An overall documentation of the project is provided on a Visual Paradigm file with UML diagrams and description, as well as on the SRS document of the project (folder vpp).
